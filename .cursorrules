<project_specifications>
Project Name: Narratrix
Architecture: Desktop application using Tauri framework
Primary Technologies:
- Backend: Rust with Tauri v2
- Frontend: React + Vite
- Database: SQLite
- Tailor your responses to UI components: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + lucide-react
- Backend cargos: tauri-plugin-sql, tauri-plugin-opener, tauri-plugin-dialog, tauri-plugin-fs, argon2

Assume all those technoligies are already installed! Do not provide instructions to install again.
</project_specifications>

<development_standards>
1. TypeScript Requirements:
   - Strict typing for all new code
   - Explicit type declarations for variables, functions, and return types
   - No 'any' types unless absolutely necessary
   - Use interface/type definitions for data structures

2. Code Organization:
   - Follow project structure:

   - Use relative imports exclusively
   - Maintain clear separation between frontend and backend concerns, and only fulfill what the user asks for

3. Development Practices:
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Do not install dependencies, assume they are already installed or suggest the correct command to install them
   - Follow Rust and Tauri security best practices
   - Optimize for performance and bundle size
</development_standards>

<coding_guidelines>
1. Frontend (React):
   - Use functional components
   - Implement proper state management
   - Follow React hooks best practices
   - Maintain consistent component structure
   - Use shadcn/ui for components
   - Use lucide-react for icons
   - Use tailwindcss V4 for styling
   - Use zustand for global state management
   - Consider using useMemo and useCallback for performance, but only if necessary

2. Backend (Rust/Tauri v2):
   - Follow Rust idioms and patterns
   - Implement proper error handling with Result types
   - Use appropriate Tauri APIs for system interaction
   - Maintain secure SQLite database operations
   - Use anyhow for error handling

3. General:
   - Write self-documenting code
   - Include appropriate comments for complex logic
   - Follow consistent naming conventions
   - Implement proper logging and debugging
   - Use Libraries and tools that are already installed
   - Propose new libraries if would make the code better and cleaner
   - Fulfill only what the user asks for, prefering to only recommend changes for what the user hadnt specifically asked for.
